# Comment Node Quick Start 🚀

## What is the Comment Node?

The Comment Node is an annotation tool for your flow diagrams - think of it as a sticky note that you can customize! It's perfect for:
- 📝 Adding documentation to your flows
- 💡 Leaving notes for team members
- ⚠️ Marking important sections
- 📋 Creating TODO lists within your diagram

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Add to Canvas
1. Find **"Comment"** in your toolbar (🗨️ icon)
2. Drag it onto the canvas
3. Drop it wherever you need a note

### Step 2: Customize Your Comment

#### Change the Title
- Click on "Comment" text at the top
- Type your new title (e.g., "Important Note", "TODO", "Warning")

#### Write Your Note
- Click in the large text area
- Type your comment (supports multiple lines)
- The node will automatically resize to fit your content

#### Pick a Color
1. Click the color dropdown (🎨 icon)
2. Choose from 7 colors:
   - **Yellow** - General notes
   - **Pink** - Warnings or alerts
   - **Blue** - Information
   - **Green** - Success or completed items
   - **Purple** - Special notes
   - **Orange** - Action items
   - **Gray** - Archive or low priority

#### Adjust Font Size
1. Click the font size dropdown (📝 icon)
2. Choose:
   - **Small** - For detailed notes
   - **Medium** - Default, balanced
   - **Large** - For headers or important info

### Step 3: Organize Your Workspace

- Click again to expand

#### Delete When Done
- Click the X button in the top-right
- The comment node will be removed

## Pro Tips 💡

### Color Coding System
Create a consistent color scheme:
```
🟨 Yellow  → General documentation
🟪 Pink    → Important warnings
🟦 Blue    → Technical notes
🟩 Green   → Completed/verified
🟣 Purple  → Questions/discussions
🟧 Orange  → Action items/TODO
⬜ Gray    → Archived info
```

### Keyboard Workflow
1. Drag & drop the node
2. Immediately start typing to edit title
3. Press Tab to jump to comment area
4. Use Enter for new lines

### Best Practices
- ✅ Keep titles short and descriptive
- ✅ Use bullet points for lists
- ✅ Minimize comments when working on other areas
- ✅ Use colors consistently across your project
- ❌ Don't overcrowd - spread comments out
- ❌ Don't make them too large - split if needed

## Example Use Cases
