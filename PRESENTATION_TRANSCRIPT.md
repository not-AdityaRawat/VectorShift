## 🎬 INTRODUCTION (30 seconds)

**[Screen: Show the application running]**

**You (On Camera):**
"Hello everyone! Today I'm excited to present VectorShift - a visual workflow builder that allows users to create complex data processing pipelines using a drag-and-drop interface. This project demonstrates modern web development practices, including React Flow for node-based UI, Zustand for state management, and FastAPI for backend processing. Let's dive in!"

---

## 📋 SECTION 1: PROJECT OVERVIEW (1-2 minutes)

**[Screen: Show the application interface with toolbar and canvas]**

**Narration:**
"VectorShift is a full-stack application designed to simplify workflow creation. The project consists of two main parts:

**Frontend**: Built with React, Vite, and React Flow
- A visual node-based editor where users can create workflows
- Multiple node types including Input, Output, Text, LLM, and Validator nodes
- Real-time connections between nodes showing data flow

**Backend**: Built with FastAPI and Python
- REST API for pipeline validation
- DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) detection to ensure workflows are valid
- Calculates the number of nodes and edges in the pipeline

The key innovation here is the dynamic variable system - nodes can reference variables from other nodes using a simple `{{variable}}` syntax, and the system automatically creates connections between them."

---

## 🎨 SECTION 2: FUNCTIONALITY DEMONSTRATION (3-4 minutes)

### Part A: Basic Node Operations

**[Screen: Show toolbar with node types]**

**Narration:**
"Let me show you how the application works. On the left, we have a toolbar with different node types. Let's start by creating a simple workflow."

**[Action: Drag an Input node to the canvas]**

"First, I'll drag an Input node onto the canvas. This node represents a data source. Let me configure it..."

**[Action: Click on Input node, type 'user_name' in the Name field]**

"I'll name this input 'user_name'. Notice how the field updates immediately - that's because we're using a dual-state pattern with local state for responsiveness and global state for persistence."

### Part B: Creating Connections

**[Action: Drag a Text node to the canvas]**

**Narration:**
"Now let's add a Text node. This is where the magic happens. Watch what occurs when I type in the text field..."

**[Action: Type '{{' in the text field]**

"As soon as I type two opening braces, an autocomplete dropdown appears showing all available variables. I can see 'user_name' from the Input node we just created."

**[Action: Click on 'user_name' in the dropdown]**

"When I select it, two things happen:
1. The text is completed as `{{user_name}}`
2. A connection is AUTOMATICALLY created between the Input node and the Text node

This auto-connect feature eliminates manual wiring and makes workflow creation much faster."

### Part C: Multiple Variables

**[Action: Add another Input node with name 'user_age']**

**Narration:**
"Let's make it more interesting. I'll add another Input node called 'user_age'."

**[Action: In the Text node, type 'User {{user_name}} is {{user_age}} years old']**

"Now I'll create a text template using both variables. Notice how:
- The autocomplete suggests both variables
- Each variable creates its own input handle on the left side of the Text node
- Connections are automatically created from both Input nodes to the Text node"

**[Screen: Highlight the dynamic handles on the left side of Text node]**

"See these handles? They're dynamically generated based on the variables detected in the text. The handle IDs match the variable names, making the system intuitive and flexible."

### Part D: Output Node

**[Action: Add an Output node]**

**Narration:**
"Finally, let's add an Output node to complete our pipeline. The Output node can also extract variables, making it perfect for capturing final results or intermediate outputs."

**[Action: Configure output node and connect it]**

"And there we have it - a complete data processing pipeline!"

---

## 🏗️ SECTION 3: CODE ARCHITECTURE (4-5 minutes)

**[Screen: Show VS Code with project structure]**

### Part A: Project Structure

**Narration:**
"Now let's explore the code architecture. The project follows a clean, modular structure:

```
VectorShift/
├── Frontend/
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── nodes/          # Node components
│   │   ├── components/     # UI components
│   │   ├── store.jsx       # State management
│   │   └── App.jsx         # Main application
│   └── package.json
└── backend/
    └── main.py             # FastAPI backend
```

This separation of concerns makes the code maintainable and scalable."

### Part B: Frontend Architecture

**[Screen: Open store.jsx]**

**Narration:**
"Let's start with the state management. We're using Zustand, which is lighter than Redux but equally powerful."

**[Scroll through store.jsx, highlighting key functions]**

"The store manages:
- **Nodes and edges**: The core data structures for our workflow
- **CRUD operations**: Adding, updating, and deleting nodes
- **Variable system**: `getAvailableVariables()` collects all variables from Input and Output nodes
- **Auto-connect**: `autoConnectVariable()` creates connections automatically

Here's the interesting part - the `autoConnectVariable` function:"

**[Highlight the autoConnectVariable function]**

```javascript
autoConnectVariable: (targetNodeId, variableName) => {
  // Find source node
  const sourceNode = nodes.find(node => 
    node.data.inputName === variableName
  );
  
  // Create connection
  const newEdge = {
    source: sourceNode.id,
    target: targetNodeId,
    // ... styling
  };
  
  // Add to edges
}
```

"It finds the source node that defines the variable, checks if a connection already exists to prevent duplicates, and creates a new edge with the proper handle IDs."

### Part C: Node Factory Pattern

**[Screen: Open nodeFactory.jsx]**

**Narration:**
"One of the key architectural decisions was using a factory pattern for nodes. Let me show you..."

**[Show nodeFactory.jsx code]**

"The `createNode` function takes a configuration object and returns a memoized component. This approach has several benefits:

1. **Code reusability**: All nodes share the same base logic
2. **Performance**: Memoization prevents unnecessary re-renders
3. **Consistency**: Every node looks and behaves the same way
4. **Maintainability**: Changes to BaseNode affect all node types

Here's how we create a node:"

**[Show inputNode.jsx]**

```javascript
const InputNodeConfig = createNode({
  title: 'Input',
  icon: FileInput,
  fields: [...],
  handles: [{
    dynamicId: 'inputName'  // Key feature!
  }]
});
```

"The `dynamicId` property tells BaseNode to use the field value as the handle ID, enabling our variable system."

### Part D: BaseNode Component

**[Screen: Open BaseNode.jsx]**

**Narration:**
"BaseNode is the heart of our node system. It's about 430 lines of carefully crafted React code. Let me highlight the key features:"

**[Scroll to dual-state pattern section]**

"**1. Dual-State Pattern**

We maintain both local state and global state:
- Local state (`fieldValues`) for immediate UI updates
- Global state (Zustand store) for persistence
- `isUpdatingRef` prevents infinite loops when syncing between them

This ensures text inputs are responsive - you can type smoothly without lag."

**[Scroll to variable extraction section]**

"**2. Variable Extraction**

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const regex = /\{\{([a-zA-Z_$][a-zA-Z0-9_$]*)\}\}/g;
  const matches = [...fieldValue.matchAll(regex)];
  const extractedVars = [...new Set(matches.map(match => match[1]))];
  
  // Auto-connect each variable
  extractedVars.forEach(varName => {
    autoConnectVariable(id, varName);
  });
}, [fieldValue]);
```

This effect runs whenever the field value changes, extracting variables and creating connections automatically."

**[Scroll to autocomplete section]**

"**3. Autocomplete System**

The autocomplete is triggered when users type `{{`:
- Detects cursor position
- Finds the last occurrence of `{{`
- Shows filtered variables
- Inserts the selected variable at the correct position

It's context-aware and user-friendly."

**[Scroll to dynamic handles section]**

"**4. Dynamic Handles**

```javascript
const dynamicHandles = useMemo(() => {
  return handles.map(handle => {
    if (handle.dynamicId && fieldValues[handle.dynamicId]) {
      return {
        ...handle,
        id: fieldValues[handle.dynamicId]
      };
    }
    return handle;
  });
}, [handles, fieldValues]);
```

This computes handle IDs on the fly based on field values. When an Input node's name is 'user_input', its handle ID becomes 'user_input', not a generic 'value'."

### Part E: Performance Optimizations

**[Screen: Show memo and useMemo usage]**

**Narration:**
"Performance was a key concern. We implemented several optimizations:

**1. React.memo**: All node components are memoized with shallow comparison
**2. useMemo**: Expensive computations like dynamic handles are cached
**3. Static configs**: Node configurations are created outside components
**4. Feedback loop prevention**: `isUpdatingRef` prevents state sync loops

These optimizations ensure smooth dragging even with many nodes on the canvas."

## 🔧 SECTION 4: BACKEND ARCHITECTURE (2-3 minutes)

**[Screen: Open main.py]**

**Narration:**
"Now let's look at the backend. It's built with FastAPI, a modern Python framework known for speed and ease of use."

**[Highlight the CORS middleware]**

"First, we configure CORS to allow requests from our frontend running on localhost:5173."

**[Scroll to the pipeline endpoint]**

"The main endpoint is `/pipelines/parse`. It receives the workflow data - nodes and edges - and performs validation."

**[Highlight the is_dag function]**

"The most important validation is checking if the workflow forms a DAG - Directed Acyclic Graph:

```python
def is_dag(nodes, edges) -> bool:
    # Build adjacency list
    graph = {node['id']: [] for node in nodes}
    
    for edge in edges:
        graph[source].append(target)
    
    # DFS cycle detection
    def has_cycle(node_id):
        visited.add(node_id)
        rec_stack.add(node_id)
        
        for neighbor in graph[node_id]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                if has_cycle(neighbor):
                    return True
            elif neighbor in rec_stack:
                return True  # Cycle detected!
```

This uses Depth-First Search with a recursion stack to detect cycles. If there's a cycle, the workflow is invalid because it would cause infinite loops."

**[Scroll to the response]**

"The API returns:
- Number of nodes
- Number of edges
- Whether it's a valid DAG

This information helps users understand their workflow structure and catch errors early."

## 💡 SECTION 5: KEY TECHNICAL DECISIONS (2 minutes)

**[Screen: Back to you on camera with code in background]**

**Narration:**
"Let me discuss some key technical decisions and their rationale:

**1. Why Zustand over Redux?**
- Simpler API with less boilerplate
- Better TypeScript support
- Smaller bundle size
- Sufficient for our needs - we don't need Redux's middleware ecosystem

**2. Why React Flow?**
- Battle-tested library for node-based UIs
- Handles complex edge cases like node positioning, zooming, panning
- Customizable with our own node components
- Good performance with many nodes

**3. Why Factory Pattern for Nodes?**
- Initially, we had separate components for each node type
- This led to code duplication and inconsistency
- The factory pattern centralizes logic in BaseNode
- New node types can be created with just configuration

**4. Why Dual-State Pattern?**
- React Flow's node updates can be slow because they go through the store
- Users expect immediate feedback when typing
- Local state provides instant updates
- Store sync happens in the background
- Best of both worlds - responsiveness and persistence

**5. Why Auto-Connect?**
- Manual connection is tedious and error-prone
- Users might forget to connect variables
- Auto-connect is intuitive - if you reference a variable, you need its data
- Can still manually disconnect if needed"

## 🐛 SECTION 6: CHALLENGES OVERCOME (2 minutes)

**[Screen: Show code with annotations]**

**Narration:**
"Building this wasn't without challenges. Let me share some interesting problems we solved:

**Challenge 1: The One-Letter-at-a-Time Bug**

Initially, text inputs would only accept one character before losing focus. The issue?

```javascript
// WRONG - Creates new component on every render
const InputNode = ({ id, data }) => {
  const Component = createNode(config);  // ❌
  return <Component id={id} data={data} />;
};
```

Solution: Move config creation outside the component:

```javascript
// CORRECT - Component created once
const InputNodeConfig = createNode(config);

const InputNode = ({ id, data }) => {
  return <InputNodeConfig id={id} data={data} />;
};
```

**Challenge 2: Continuous Re-rendering During Drag**

Every node was re-rendering when dragging a single node. Why?

The `data` prop was getting a new reference on every update, causing all nodes to re-render.

Solution: 
- Memoize node components with shallow comparison
- Only update when actual data values change, not references

**Challenge 3: State Sync Feedback Loops**

Local state updates triggered store updates, which triggered local state updates, creating an infinite loop.

Solution: Use a ref to track update source:

```javascript
const isUpdatingRef = useRef(false);

const handleFieldChange = (fieldName, value) => {
  setFieldValues(prev => ({ ...prev, [fieldName]: value }));
  isUpdatingRef.current = true;
  updateNodeField(id, fieldName, value);
};

useEffect(() => {
  if (isUpdatingRef.current) {
    isUpdatingRef.current = false;
    return; // Skip sync
  }
  // Sync store to local state
}, [data]);
```

**Challenge 4: Autocomplete Positioning**

Initially tried calculating absolute cursor position, but it was complex and buggy.

Solution: Use relative positioning with CSS:
- Wrap input in a container
- Position dropdown relative to container
- Much simpler and more reliable"

## 🎯 SECTION 7: FEATURES SHOWCASE (2 minutes)

**[Screen: Back to the application]**

**Narration:**
"Let me showcase some additional features:

**1. Multiple Node Types**

We support 6 different node types:
- **Input**: Data sources with configurable names
- **Output**: Data destinations
- **Text**: Text processing with variable interpolation
- **LLM**: Large Language Model integration
- **Validator**: Data validation with multiple conditions
- **Comment**: Annotations (no data flow)"

**[Demonstrate each node type quickly]**

"**2. Validation Node**

The Validator node is particularly interesting - it has dual outputs for pass/fail scenarios."

**[Show validator node with multiple validation rules]**

"**3. Visual Feedback**

- Animated connections show data flow direction
- Color-coded nodes by type
- Dynamic handles appear/disappear based on content
- Real-time variable detection and display"

**[Show these features in action]**

"**4. Responsive Design**

## 📊 SECTION 8: BACKEND INTEGRATION (1-2 minutes)

**[Screen: Show the Submit button and network tab]**

**Narration:**
"Let me demonstrate the backend integration. When users click Submit, the workflow is sent to our FastAPI backend for validation."

**[Action: Click Submit button, show network request in DevTools]**

"Here's what happens:
1. Frontend collects all nodes and edges
2. Sends POST request to `/pipelines/parse`
3. Backend validates the structure
4. Returns analysis results"

**[Show the response]**

"The response shows:
- Number of nodes: 4
- Number of edges: 3
- Is DAG: true

If the workflow had a cycle, `is_dag` would be false, and we could show an error to the user."

**[Show the backend terminal with logs]**

"On the backend, we can see the request being processed. This architecture allows for future expansion - we could add:
- Workflow execution
- Data transformation
- AI model integration
- Workflow templates"

"Building VectorShift taught me several valuable lessons:

**1. Component Architecture Matters**
- Starting with a good architecture saves time later
- The factory pattern made adding new node types trivial
- Separation of concerns (BaseNode vs node configs) was crucial

**2. Performance from Day One**
- Don't wait for performance issues to appear
- Memoization, useMemo, and useCallback should be default
- Profile early, profile often

**3. State Management Strategy**
- Different parts of the app have different state needs
- Local state for UI responsiveness
- Global state for data that needs to be shared
- Don't over-engineer - Zustand was perfect for our needs

**4. User Experience Details**
- Auto-connect seems like a small feature but makes huge impact
- Autocomplete transforms the user experience
- Visual feedback (animations, colors) guides users
- Small touches like ESC to close dropdown matter

**5. Testing Edge Cases**
- The cycle detection in DAG validation handles complex scenarios
- Variable extraction regex was carefully crafted
